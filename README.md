# C what I did there? 
These are the actual baby steps of my career shift to coding - the first programs I ever made that I was proud of! These were created during the Hive Helsinki Piscine and during my independent studies in the weeks following the Piscine.

### f2cfloat.c 
A program that displays a conversion of Fahrenheit to Celcius on the standard output

### ft_foreach.c 
A program that applies a function on all elements of an array

### ft_strcmp.c 
A remake of the standard function strcmp. strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2) compares the string pointed to by str1, to the string pointed to by str2. Return values are as follows:
- less than 0 indicates str1 is less than str2.
- greater than 0 indicates str2 is less than str1.
- equal to 0 indicates str1 is equal to str2.

### rev_print.c 
A program that takes a string and displays it in reverse followed by a newline. If the number of parameters is not 1, the program displays a newline.

### rotone.c
A program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its letters to the next one in alphabetical order. 'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'. Case remains unaffected. The output will be followed by a \n. If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays \n.

## How to test it:
- Each program has its own pre-compiled binary. 
- The programs rev_print and rotone receive their arguments from the command line.
- Feel free to also edit the main functions and re-compile the binary files to run your own tests, too.
