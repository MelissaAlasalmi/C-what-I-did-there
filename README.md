C what I did there? 
Here's a beginners' portfolio for my studies in C! These are small programs I have put together during the Hive Helsinki Piscine and during my independent studies.

f2cfloat.c - A program that displays a conversion of fahrenheit to celcius on the standard output

ft_foreach.c - A program that applies a function on all elements of an array

ft_strcmp.c - A remake of the standard function strcmp, which compares the null-terminated strings “s1” and “s2” and returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according as the string “s1” is greater than, equal to, or less than the string “s2”.

rev_print.c - A program that takes a string and displays it in reverse followed by a newline. If the number of parameters is not 1, the program displays a newline.

rotone.c - A program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its letters by the next one in alphabetical order. 'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'. Case remains unaffected. The output will be followed by a \n. If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays \n.
