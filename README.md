# C what I did there? 
These are the actual baby steps of my career shift to coding - the first programs I ever made that I was proud of! These were created during the Hive Helsinki Piscine and during my independent studies in the weeks following the Piscine.

## f2cfloat.c 
A program that displays a conversion of fahrenheit to celcius on the standard output

## ft_foreach.c 
A program that applies a function on all elements of an array

## ft_strcmp.c 
A remake of the standard function strcmp, which compares the null-terminated strings “s1” and “s2” and returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according as the string “s1” is greater than, equal to, or less than the string “s2”.

## rev_print.c 
A program that takes a string and displays it in reverse followed by a newline. If the number of parameters is not 1, the program displays a newline.

## rotone.c
A program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its letters by the next one in alphabetical order. 'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'. Case remains unaffected. The output will be followed by a \n. If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays \n.
